    <p>Springtime in Indiana is never predictable, it could be filled with sunshine, rain, and even snow.
        The best way to prepare for Spring is to keep a range of clothing handy, because you never know 
        what weather will bring.
        As April comes around and the days get longer, it seems the unpredictable 
        nature of the Indiana spring weather gets a bit more stable. There 
        will still be days where the weather seems to dip to lows uncharacteristic 
        of this time of year, but they will be fewer and farther between. Most of 
        April the weather hovers in the 60s and 70s. The days are sunnier, with 
        less rain, and you can start to feel the warmth that the month of May brings, 
        kicking off a hot Indiana summer. By mid to late May, the days are getting long, hot, and humid.
